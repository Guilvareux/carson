# Tests
Need a number of simple syntax checkers





All the way up to complex tests


## Syntax
- Load in ontologies

## Simple
- Use a number of scenarios and simply count a predetermined number of vnfs etc
- Test a simple path predicate between all the VNFs (with unique destinations) and count.
- Simply verify that nothing is fundamentally broken.

## Complex
- Testing algorithms like `shortest_network_path`
